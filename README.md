# Applied AI Systems

This repository contains a collection of applied AI and automation projects
focused on solving real-world problems using modern AI models, APIs,
and workflow orchestration tools.

The goal of this work is to explore how intelligent systems can reduce
manual effort, improve reliability, and support decision-making in
practical, everyday scenarios.

---

## Project Areas

### Foundational Systems
Core automation and AI-assisted workflows that establish reliable
foundations such as messaging, data handling, and basic integrations.

### Workflow Automation
End-to-end automations that integrate external services (e.g. email,
calendars, databases) to eliminate repetitive operational tasks.

### Agent-Based Systems
AI agents capable of reasoning, maintaining context, and selecting
appropriate actions across multiple tools and services.

---

## Design Principles

- Focus on real-world use cases rather than demos
- Prefer clarity and reliability over complexity
- Verify external state before taking destructive actions
- Treat AI as an assistant, not a replacement for logic

---

## Technologies Used

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- API-based integrations (Google services, messaging platforms)
- Workflow orchestration tools (e.g. n8n)
- Context and memory handling for agent behavior

---

## Status

This repository is actively maintained and expanded as new systems
are designed, tested, and refined.
